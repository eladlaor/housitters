            <h3>How does Housitters work?</h3>
            <p>
              Our website provides a platform where house owners can create listings detailing their
              house-sitting requirements. Sitters can then browse these listings and apply to become
              the perfect match. The house owner and sitter can communicate, exchange information,
              and agree on the terms of the house-sitting arrangement. It's all about building trust
              and finding the right fit for both parties.
