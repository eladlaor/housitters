# Housitters.com

## Why
Currently, if you are a house sitter or a pet parent, the experience of searching a sitter/house is pretty gruesome. 
It is either free but very inconvenient (Facebook, allowing no search filters whatsoever),
or convenient but costly (like some other websites out there).
Housitters.com aims to create a housitting marketplace which is both free and user friendly.
