## Problem Solved

Facebook, we have a bone to pick with you!

Nowadays, if you are a house-sitter or a pet-parent, the experience of finding what you're looking for is pretty gruesome.

Services other than Housitters.com are currently either:

- **Free but inconvenient**: Facebook, allowing no search filters, displaying posts in non-chronological order.
- **Convenient but costly**: similar house-sitting websites charge around 200 USD for a yearly subscription.

Housitters.com is the first house-sitting marketplace which is both free and user-friendly.

We can finally stop chasing our own tail :)

## Personal Motivation

### Coding Motivation

Since my work experience (in Codefresh) included only backend development, I wanted to learn frontend by developing a real-world service. This was my way to gradually acquire frontend skills, aiming to become a full-stack developer.

### House-sitting Motivation

I've been a house-sitter since April 2021. For a year, I wrote a monthly personal blog about it in "Haaretz", one of Israel's most prominent newspapers:
[Read it here](https://www.haaretz.co.il/blogs/eladlaor).

Personally, my experience has been smooth, likely due to the exposure from my blog. I've received more house-sitting invitations than I could accept. However, as I was getting to know the house-sitting community, I recognized a common frustration with existing services.
This presented a unique opportunity for me to both develop my coding skills and address a genuine problem in my community.

Like ~~hitting two birds with one stone~~ racing two dogs with one ball.

## Usage and Features

### Signup

To explore pets, houses, and house-sitters, you first need to sign up.
Upon signing up, you define yourself as either a `landlord` or a `housitter`.
The interface varies according to the user type.

### With Housitters.com, you can:

- Create and edit a profile and a public post, respective to your user type.
- Contact (or get contacted by) other registered members.
- Filter searches for either houses or sitters:
  - By date (single range / multiple ranges / Anytime).
  - By location (house-sitters can search multiple locations, landlords are limited to one).
  - These search filters are separate from the date and location settings on your own public post.
- Sort the results according to relevant criteria.
- Bookmark favorite sitters or houses.
- Post and read reviews on other users.
- Get in touch with the site's developer (me:) for feedback or suggestions.
- Efficiently manage prior chats using a personal inbox.

### Future Plans

- Add a Hebrew interface, with an option to select the site's language (default: according to the user's ip address).
- Modify the location options to allow international users.
- Introduce a user setting for receiving email notifications upon getting a message on the platform. A preliminary implementation exists, but due to potential spam concerns, I still have some figuring out to do, to ensure user satisfaction.
- Add an easy "Invite a Friend" option.
- Improve the design.
- Launch :)
