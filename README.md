# Housitters.com

## Why
Currently, if you are a house sitter or a pet parent, the experience of searching a sitter/house is pretty gruesome. 
It is either free but very inconvenient (Facebook, allowing no search filters whatsoever),
or convenient but costly (like some other websites out there).
Housitters.com aims to create a housitting marketplace which is both free and user friendly.

## Work in Progress
While on the backend level the site is operational with some pretty comprehensive features, not all of them are yet complete.
Also, the styling and design is still far from ready. 
However, feel free to test out the website, register as either a pet parent or a housitter, and have some fun with it :)

## Available Features
* User registration (as housitter / landlord)
* filter your search by dates and locations
* as a landlord, you have multiple ways in which you can reach a sitter (by an active post or by simply being discoverable in the housitter's search results).
* add to a 'Favourites' list.
* see (and add) reviews on users.
